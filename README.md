# Software Development Lifecycle Overview

## Project summary
The Software Development LifeCycle course explains the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle
Apply the stages of the software development life cycle within an agile development environment
Evaluate various software development methodologies and tools

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs and implement them, various tools such as in-app surveys, focus groups, and user interviews
can be used to analyze user requirements. Sometimes you have to put yourself in the position of the user.
Ask yourself who they are, what they need, and why they need it.
User stories keep the focus on the user. This keeps the team focused on tasks that need to be checked off. User stories enable collaboration
drive creative solutions and create momentum. User stories express the customer's perspective so that the development team can focus more on
day-to-day activity, creativity, collaboration, and, most importantly, better outcomes.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
A structured approach can be considered when developing software projects.
It is important to define objectives and scope: 
- understand the project's purpose, goals, and objectives
- define the scope, features, functionalities, and deliverables of the software.
Gather requirements:
- Engage stakeholders to gather and document detailed requirements
- Create a project plan and develop it.

All Agile processes are good to take. In my future development project, I will try to incorporate all the smaller cycles representing Agile,
and that moves from beginning to end. It consists of 6 phases:
* Concept
* Inception
* Iteration
* Release
* Maintenance, and retirement

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means being a team player.
A team player is someone who actively contributes to their group to complete tasks, meet goals, or manage projects.
You have to listen to your coworkers, respect ideas, and aim to improve the product or process at hand.
